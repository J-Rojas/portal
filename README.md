# Portal
The **Portal** is a server agnostic JavaScript library that not just provides a socket for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers, but also aims to utilize a full duplex connection for modern web application development.

There is the **Portal for Java** project which is a reference implementation of the server counterpart written in Java. Look at it to implement a portal server in other languages. Sample applications are available in each server counterpart project.

The **Portal** and **Portal for Java** project is developed and maintained by [Donghwan Kim](http://twitter.com/flowersits). If you are interested, please subscribe to the [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/portal_project).

## Installing
Add and load portal.js to your application:
```html
<script src="portal-1.0.js"></script>
```
Then, install a server counterpart or implement new one. The following projects are now available.
